# Overall

1. Document code
2. Update starting page to display text rather than an image
3. Test on Linux machine (use pyudev for listing cameras?)

## Image Analyzer

1. When adding a new face, indicate the progress of the analyzer as its updates its cache of known faces (Progress bar, spinner). Potentially disable other inputs as this takes place
